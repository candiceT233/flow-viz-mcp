DFL Visualization MCP Server - Development Session Summary
Date: November 5, 2025
LLM Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro
================================================================================

## Session Overview

This session focused on incorporating user feedback regarding server performance, agent interaction, and future development plans into the project documentation. The primary outcome was the creation of new V2 planning and specification documents.

================================================================================
## Major Issues Resolved
================================================================================

N/A - This session was focused on planning and documentation updates based on user feedback, rather than resolving specific code issues.

================================================================================
## Code Changes Summary
================================================================================

N/A - No code changes were made during this session. The focus was entirely on documentation.

================================================================================
## Files Modified/Created
================================================================================

### Files Created:
- `docs/v2_spec.md`: New technical specification document outlining V2 features, including a "Performance, Efficiency, and Agent Interaction" section, and new components for Dataflow Performance Matching (DPM), Workflow Optimization Advisor, and multi-profiler support (Datalife/DaYu).
- `docs/v2_plan.md`: New implementation plan document, marking V1 tasks as complete and detailing the steps for implementing the new V2 features.

## Conversation Summary
================================================================================

1.  **Initial Review**: The session began with the agent confirming review of `AGENT.md` and the latest session summary (`sessions/cursor-nov-4-2025.txt`).
2.  **Feedback Discussion**: The user presented feedback received on the project, focusing on:
    *   Agent interaction with the MCP server and its tools.
    *   Server performance, delivery speed, component design, and resource efficiency.
    *   Improving internal server design and understanding protocols.
3.  **Documentation Strategy**: The agent proposed a strategy for updating documentation:
    *   `docs/request.md` should remain unchanged as a historical artifact.
    *   `docs/plan.md` (now `v1_plan.md`) could be archived or deprecated.
    *   `docs/spec.md` (now `v1_spec.md`) was identified as the primary document to update with performance and design details.
4.  **New Component Introduction**: The user introduced three new components for the project:
    *   **DPM (Dataflow Performance Matching)**: A core recommendation component.
    *   **Workflow Pattern Characterization, Analysis, and I/O Improvement Recommendation**: A new advisory component.
    *   **Profiling Component**: Support for Datalife (POSIX I/O) and DaYu (HDF5 I/O).
5.  **V2 Document Creation**: The user requested the creation of new `v2_plan.md` and `v2_spec.md` files in the `docs` folder, incorporating all discussed feedback and new component requirements.
6.  **Document Generation**: The agent successfully created both `docs/v2_spec.md` and `docs/v2_plan.md`, detailing the new features, performance considerations, and implementation steps.
